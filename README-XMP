XMP support
===========
Todo: 
+ What are the plans, design
+ What is already supported, what is not.

XMP toolkit installation
========================
This is what worked for me on a Debian GNU/Linux (testing) 
system. Your mileage may vary. Please check with Adobe if 
you encounter problems with the XMP toolkit installation.

Installation directory
----------------------
The top-level exiv2 directory ($HOME/src/exiv2/ on my system).

If you install XMP elsewhere, or use different OS or STAGE
options to the make command below, you will need to manually
modify the exiv2/config/config.mk.in (before running the 
configure script). There is no autoconf-magic yet to set 
this via configure options.

External packages (non-Debian)
-----------------
xmp_v411_sdk.zip    - from adobe.com
expat-2.0.1.tar.gz  - from sourceforge.net
exiv2               - from SVN

Installation steps
------------------
cd $HOME/src/exiv2/
cp /path/to/xmp_v411_sdk.zip ./
unzip xmp_v411_sdk.zip

cp /path/to/expat-2.0.1.tar.gz XMP-SDK/third-party/
cd XMP-SDK/third-party/
tar zxvf expat-2.0.1.tar.gz
mv expat expat-orig
mv expat-2.0.1 expat

cd ../build/gcc
make -f XMPCore.mak OS=i80386linux STAGE=debug

Expected result
---------------
Now there should be a library
../../public/libraries/i80386linux/debug/libXMPCoreStaticDebug.a
